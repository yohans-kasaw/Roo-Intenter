  <overview>
    Examples of assembling template-free issue prompts grounded by codebase exploration, with optional CLI submission after explicit confirmation.
    Repository detection precedes submission; review and submission occur in a single merged step offering "Submit now" or "Submit now and assign to me". Any other response is treated as a change request.

## Type
Bug

## Problem / Value
In dark theme, the Submit button is hard to see on the new run form, making it difficult for users to complete new runs.

## Context
Affects users creating new runs with dark theme enabled; the button appears low-contrast and is difficult to locate.

## Reproduction
1) Steps: Open "New Run" -> Scroll to bottom -> Look for Submit
2) Expected result: Clearly visible, high-contrast Submit button
3) Actual result: Button appears nearly invisible in dark theme
4) Variations tried: Different browsers (Chrome/Firefox) show same result

      I accidentally click "Copy Run" sometimes; would be great to have a simple confirmation.

## Type
Enhancement

## Problem / Value
Add a confirmation dialog before copying an existing run to prevent accidental duplication.

## Context
Users sometimes click "Copy Run" by mistake when browsing runs; a simple confirmation would prevent accidental duplication.

## Constraints/Preferences
Keep the flow lightweight and unobtrusive; avoid slowing down intentional copies.
